# Dash Docs

See the site at [circularstudios.com/Dash](https://circularstudios.com/Dash).

## Compiling

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and the [Ruby Devkit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) must be installed. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) compiles the docs from Markdown into HTML. 

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
